## What AppShots Does

AppShots lets mobile developers and marketers design polished app store screenshots entirely in the browser. Users select a device frame, upload their app screenshot, add text and decorations, and export pixel-perfect images at the required App Store or Play Store resolutions. Everything runs client-side — no server uploads, no accounts, no watermarks.

## Architecture

AppShots is a single-page application. All state is managed client-side with React Context (EditorContext) and persisted to localStorage.

### Key Modules
- `EditorContext` — Global editor state: active project, screenshots, device selection, font settings
- `CanvasPreview` — Main canvas rendering screenshots, device containers, overlays
- `DeviceFrame` — Device mockup rendering in flat 2D and 3D with edges
- `FontPicker` — Google Fonts search, preview, and selection
- `LeftSidebar` — Device picker, color picker, export controls
- `RightSidebar` — Layout, appearance, content, and overlay controls
- `RichTextEditor` — Rich text formatting toolbar
- `ProjectSwitcher` — Project management UI
- `export-utils` — Canvas-based screenshot export supporting flat and 3D
- `google-fonts` — Google Fonts API loader
- `rich-text-canvas` — Rich text rendering for canvas export

### Data Model
- **Project**: Contains a name, device selection, export size, and a list of Screenshots
- **Screenshot**: Headline, subheadline, screenshot image, background settings, text positions, font family, overlay images, device scale/offset/rotation/shadow, 3D settings
- **ImageOverlay**: Positioned image with layer ordering, rotation, and shadow
- **DeviceSpec**: Device dimensions, screen inset, corner radius, notch/island info, available colors

## Typical Workflow

1. Select a device from the left sidebar
2. Choose a device frame color
3. Upload an app screenshot to display inside the device
4. Edit headline and subheadline text using the rich text editor
5. Pick a font from Google Fonts
6. Set background color or gradient
7. Position the device with presets or manual controls
8. Optionally switch to 3D mode and adjust rotation
9. Add overlay images (badges, logos)
10. Add more screenshots to the carousel for a complete set
11. Export all screenshots at App Store resolution

## API / Integration Points

AppShots is entirely client-side. There are no backend APIs. Data flows:
- Google Fonts API — loads font metadata and stylesheets
- Canvas API — renders and exports screenshots as PNG
- localStorage — persists projects and settings
- JSZip — bundles multiple screenshots into a ZIP file for download
